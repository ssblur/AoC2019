# Advent of Code 2019

## Event

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an annual event where developers get the chance to solve puzzles which are suited for computers. The site itself does a much better job of describing it.

Each day is in its own folder, with a separate file or module for each part available.

## Language

This is another pass at 2019, replicating my original "Different Language Every Day" approach, but sticking to it. Each day will have its own `README.md` which will contain details on that day's language and incredibly basic comments on implementation. Some solutions may repeat languages, if the solution contains components which are used in future days.

I plan for most of these are scripting languages because most of them have interpreters. I want languages with simple compilers or interpreters because they are easy to set up and don't pollute the day's folder too much.
