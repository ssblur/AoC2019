# Day 1

## Language

I'm sure you all know C, but it's a classic. I'd be remiss if I didn't have at least *one* day done in C, since I don't get to use it often at all.

## Implementation

Part 1 is simple. Perform the calculation, then add the result to the total variable.

Part 2 is somewhat more complex, but still incredibly basic. When calculating fuel for any given module, keep adding the fuel value for the mass of the previous fuel until the extra fuel is less than or equal to 0, then add that fuel total to the proper total.
